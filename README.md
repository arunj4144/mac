User Data and Safety

The script operates in a non-invasive way, but it’s important to note:
	•	Cleaning Temporary Files: The script deletes cached files that are typically safe to remove (e.g., browser caches, system logs). These should not affect your personal data, but it is always a good practice to ensure that no important files are stored in those folders.
	•	Deleting Large Files: The script allows the user to delete large files, but it does not automatically delete them unless the user confirms the action. You should double-check the file paths before confirming deletion.
	•	Network Tools and System Status: These actions are read-only and will not modify or affect your system.

Important: Always make sure to have backups of important files before running cleanup scripts or deleting large files, just to be safe.

Folders Accessed by the Script

The script goes through the following folders for cleaning temporary files and opening junk directories:


	•	$HOME/Library/Caches: User-specific cache files.
	•	/Library/Caches: System-wide cache files.
	•	/private/var/folders: System’s temporary files.
	•	$HOME/Downloads/ChunkTemp: Temporary files generated by downloads.
	•	$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cache: Google Chrome cache.
	•	$HOME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*/cache2: Firefox cache.
	•	$HOME/Library/Logs: Log files for various applications.
	•	/private/var/log: System log files.
